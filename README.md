### Hi there 👋
I'm a Chemical-Environmental Engineer, with work experience in industry, research, and the public sector. My love for data and abilities with statistics made me decide to turn into a data scientist, and I recently completed a data science bootcamp to sharpen my skills. I am deeply committed to promoting sustainable practices and finding innovative solutions to address environmental challenges. I believe that technology and data-driven approaches can play a significant role in creating a more sustainable future.
 
While I enjoy working with all types of data, I have a particular passion for Python, SQL, Machine Learning and specially for data visualization, which I find to be a powerful tool for communicating insights and inspiring action 📈🌍 
I am eager to apply my expertise in data science to contribute to innovative and sustainable solutions for today's challenges. Let's connect and discuss how data can help us to create a positive change! 

⚡ Currently I work as a Data and Business Analyst at CIMPA - Hamburg, Germany. 

✨ From May to July 2023 I was task leader and collaborator of an Omdena project as a volunteer.
Project: Precision Millet Farming-Leveraging Geospatial Technology to Optimize Crop Selection and Yield

🔭 I’m currently learning SQL, Cloud Computing and of course more Python!
