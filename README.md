### Hi there 👋
I'm a Chemical-Environmental Engineer turned Data Scientist, with work experience in industry, research, and the public sector. My love for data and abilities with statistics made me decide to turn into a data scientist, and I recently completed a data science bootcamp to sharpen my skills. 

While I enjoy working with all types of data, I have a particular passion for data visualization, which I find to be a powerful tool for communicating insights and inspiring action. 📈🌍 When I'm not diving into data, I enjoy exploring nature 🍃 and running. 

 I am eager to apply my expertise in data science to contribute to innovative and sustainable solutions for today's challenges. Let's connect and discuss how data can help us to create a positive change! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an Omdena project as a volunteer: Precision Millet Farming-Leveraging Geospatial Technology to Optimize Crop Selection and Yield
- ⚗️ I’m currently learning SQL, Cloud Computing and of course more Python!
