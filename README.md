### Hi there 👋
I'm a Chemical-Environmental Engineer, with work experience in industry, research, and the public sector. My love for data and abilities with statistics made me decide to turn into a data scientist, and I recently completed a data science bootcamp to sharpen my skills. 

While I enjoy working with all types of data, I have a particular passion for Python, SQL, Machine Learning and specially for data visualization, which I find to be a powerful tool for communicating insights and inspiring action 📈🌍 
I am eager to apply my expertise in data science to contribute to innovative and sustainable solutions for today's challenges. Let's connect and discuss how data can help us to create a positive change! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an Omdena project as a volunteer: Precision Millet Farming-Leveraging Geospatial Technology to Optimize Crop Selection and Yield
- ⚗️ I’m currently learning SQL, Cloud Computing and of course more Python!

When I'm not immersed in data, you can find me exploring the wonders of nature 🍃 and staying active through running 🏃‍♀️  I believe that maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle fuels creativity and enhances productivity in all aspects of life.
