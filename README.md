### Hi there 👋
I'm a Chemical-Environmental Engineer, with work experience in industry, research, and the public sector. My love for data and abilities with statistics made me decide to turn into a data scientist, so I completed a data science bootcamp to sharpen my skills. 
 
While I enjoy working with all types of data, I have a particular passion for Python, SQL, Machine Learning and specially for data visualization, which I find to be a powerful tool for communicating insights and inspiring action 📈🌍 

⚡ Currently I work as a Data and Business Analyst at CIMPA - Hamburg, Germany. I specialize in implementing the Airbus Operation System (AOS) and 5S methodology at the Airbus site in Hamburg. My focus is on the new hangar for the A321XLR airplane line, where I work in the digitalization efforts for related processes, ensuring streamlined and efficient operations.

💡 Recent Project:
I developed a Python-based web scraper for Request for Proposals (RFPs), designed to automatically search relevant websites for RFP postings. This project also includes a Streamlit app that allows users to subscribe to selected websites and receive email notifications when a relevant RFP is found. The app integrates automated notifications, making it easier for users to stay updated on opportunities.


✨ From May to July 2023 I was task leader and collaborator of an Omdena project as a volunteer.
Project: Precision Millet Farming-Leveraging Geospatial Technology to Optimize Crop Selection and Yield

🔭 I’m currently learning SQL, Cloud Computing and of course more Python!
