### Hi there 👋

I’m a Chemical-Environmental Engineer with experience in industry, research, and the public sector. My love for data and skills in statistics led me to transition into data science, and I completed a data science bootcamp to sharpen my technical abilities.

While I enjoy working with all types of data, I have a particular passion for Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and especially data visualization, which I find to be a powerful tool for communicating insights and inspiring action 📈🌍

⚡ Currently, I work as a Data and Business Analyst at CIMPA – Hamburg, Germany. I specialize in implementing the Airbus Operation System (AOS) and 5S methodology at the Airbus site in Hamburg. My focus is on the new hangar for the A321XLR airplane line, where I support digitalization efforts to ensure streamlined and efficient operations.

💡 Recent Projects:

1. Developed a Python-based web scraper for Request for Proposals (RFPs), integrated with a Streamlit app for website subscription and automated email alerts.
 
2. Participated in Urban Green Space Segmentation with U-Net – an Omdena Frankfurt project using satellite imagery and deep learning to map green spaces and promote urban sustainability.
 
3. Task Leader and Collaborator (May–July 2023) in an Omdena project on Precision Millet Farming, leveraging geospatial technology to optimize crop selection and yield.

🔭 I’m currently learning Generative AI, SQL, Cloud Computing, and of course, more Python!
